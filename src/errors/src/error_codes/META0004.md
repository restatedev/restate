## META0004

Cannot register the provided service endpoint, because it conflicts with the uri of an already registered service endpoint.

In Restate service endpoints have a unique uri and are immutable, thus it's not possible to discover the same endpoint uri twice. 
Make sure, when updating a service endpoint, to assign it a new uri. 

You can force the override using the `"force": true` field in the discover request, but beware that this can lead in-flight invocations to an unrecoverable error state.  

See the [versioning documentation](http://restate.dev/docs/deployment-operations/versioning) for more information.
