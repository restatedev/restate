## META0001

Bad service definition encountered while registering/updating a service.
When defining a service, make sure:

* The service has at least one method 
* Use a fully qualified service name (`package_name.service_name`) that doesn't start with `dev.restate` or `grpc`
* The service is annotated with the `dev.restate.ext.service_type` extension

Example:

```protobuf
syntax = "proto3";
import "dev/restate/ext.proto";

package com.example;

service HelloWorld {
  option (dev.restate.ext.service_type) = KEYED;

  rpc greet (GreetingRequest) returns (GreetingResponse);
}
```
