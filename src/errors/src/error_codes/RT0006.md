## RT0006

An error occurred while invoking the service endpoint. 
This is a generic error which can be caused by many reasons, including:

* Transient network or storage errors
* Misconfiguration of the service endpoint and/or of the Restate runtime
* Non-deterministic user code execution
* Restate runtime and/or SDK bug

In some cases, the error will be retried depending on the configured retry policy. 
We suggest checking the service endpoint logs as well to get any hint on the error cause.
