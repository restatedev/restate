## RT0006

An error occurred while invoking the service endpoint. 
This is a generic error which can be caused by many reasons, including:

* Transient network or storage errors
* Misconfiguration of the service endpoint and/or of the Restate runtime
* Non-deterministic user code execution
* Restate runtime and/or SDK bug

We suggest checking the service endpoint logs as well to get any hint on the error cause.
