## META0006

Cannot register the newly discovered service revision in the provided service endpoint, because it conflicts with an already existing service revision.

When implementing a new service revision, make sure that:

* The service instance type and the key definition, if any, is exactly the same as of the previous revisions.
* The Protobuf contract and message definitions are backward compatible.

See the [versioning documentation](http://docs.restate.dev/deployment-operations/versioning) for more information.
