# The standard saturation test for moderate capacity instances. Make sure that a
# Restate server is started and the Counter service is already deployed. You'll
# want to run the test for at least several minutes in order to observe the
# effects of database compaction on performance. For cleaner results, wipe the
# restate-data directory between runs.
#
# 1. Start: restate-server --config-file .../restate-1.1.0-performance.toml --base-dir ../storage
# 2. Start: cargo run --release -p mock-service-endpoint --bin mock-service-endpoint
# 3. After clean startup, run: restate deployments register http://localhost:9080 --yes
