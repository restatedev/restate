Easily build workflows, event-driven applications, and distributed services in a fault-tolerant manner with durable async/await.

[Restate](https://restate.dev) is great at building:

* [Lambda Workflows as Code](https://restate.dev/blog/we-replaced-400-lines-of-stepfunctions-asl-with-40-lines-of-typescript-by-making-lambdas-suspendable/)
* [Transactional RPC Handlers](https://github.com/restatedev/examples/tree/main/end-to-end-applications/typescript/ecommerce-store)
* [Event Processing with Kafka](https://restate.dev/blog/restate--kafka-event-driven-apps-where-event-driven-is-an-implementation-detail/)
* [Much more](https://github.com/restatedev/examples)

## Core primitives

The basic primitives Restate offers to simplify application development are the following:

* **Reliable Execution**: user code will always run to completion. Intermediate failures result in re-tries that use the durable execution mechanism to recover partial progress and not duplicate already executed steps.
* **Suspending User Code**: long-running user code suspends when awaiting on a promise and resume when that promise is resolved.
* **Reliable Communication**: user code communicates with exactly-once semantics. Restate reliably delivers messages and anchors both sender and receiver in the durable execution to ensure no losses or duplicates can happen.
* **Durable Timers**: user code can sleep (and suspend) or schedule calls for later.
* **Isolation**: user code can be keyed, which makes Restate scheduled them to obey single-writer-per-key semantics.
* **Consistent State**: keyed user code can attach key/value state, which is eagerly pushed into handlers during invocation, and written back upon completion. This is particularly efficient for FaaS deployments (stateful serverless, yay!).
* **Observability & Introspection**: Restate automatically generates Open Telemetry traces for the interactions between handlers and gives you a SQL shell to query the distributed state of the application.
