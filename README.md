[Restate](https://restate.dev) is the simplest way to build resilient applications.

Restate provides a distributed durable version of your everyday building blocks, letting you build a wide range of use cases:

* [Workflows-as-Code](https://docs.restate.dev/use-cases/workflows)
* [Microservice orchestration](https://docs.restate.dev/use-cases/microservice-orchestration)
* [Event Processing](https://docs.restate.dev/use-cases/event-processing)
* [Async Tasks](https://docs.restate.dev/use-cases/async-tasks)
* [Agents, Stateful Actors, state machines, and much more](https://github.com/restatedev/examples)

## Get started with Restate

1. üèé [Follow the Quickstart](https://docs.restate.dev/get_started/quickstart) to get Restate up and running within 2 minutes!
1. üí° [The Tour of Restate](https://docs.restate.dev/get_started/tour) walks you through the most important features of Restate.

## SDKs

Restate supports the following SDKs:

* [Typescript](https://github.com/restatedev/sdk-typescript)

## Core primitives

The basic primitives Restate offers to simplify application development are the following:

* **Reliable Execution**: Restate guarantees code runs to completion. Failures result in retries that use the [Durable Execution mechanism](https://docs.restate.dev/concepts/durable_execution) to recover partial progress and prevent re-executing completed steps.
* **Reliable Communication**: Services communicate with exactly-once semantics: whether it's [request-response, one-way messages, or scheduled tasks](https://docs.restate.dev/concepts/invocations). Restate reliably delivers messages and uses Durable Execution to ensure no losses or duplicates can happen.
* **Durable Promises and Timers**: Register Promises/Futures and timers in Restate to make them resilient to failures (e.g. sleep, webhooks, timers). Restate can recover them across failures, processes, and time.
* **Consistent State**: Implement [stateful entities](https://docs.restate.dev/concepts/services) with isolated K/V state per entity. Restate persists the K/V state updates together with the execution progress to ensure consistent state. Restate attaches the K/V state to the request on invocation, and writes it back upon completion. This is particularly efficient for FaaS deployments (stateful serverless, yay!).
* **Suspending User Code**: long-running code suspends when awaiting on a Promise/Future and resumes when that promise is resolved. This is particularly useful in combination with serverless deployments.
* **Observability & Introspection**: Restate includes a UI and CLI to inspect the [state of your application](https://docs.restate.dev/operate/introspection) across services and invocations. Restate automatically generates Open Telemetry traces for the interactions between handlers.
