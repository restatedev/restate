        // nodesets, we might never be able to seal those loglets unless we actually start those
        // nodes.
        // The origin of allowing those nodes to be in new nodesets came from the need to
        // swap log-servers with new ones on rolling upgrades (N5 starts up to replace N1 for instance).
        // This requires that we drain N1 (marking it read-only) and start up N5. New nodesets
        // after this point should not include N1 and will include N5. For now, I prefer to
        // constraint this until we have the full story on how those operations will be
        // coordinated.
