//! ## Schema
//!
//! This module contains the implementation of the schema registry.
//!
//! The schema registry takes care of:
//!
//! * Storing deployments, handle registration
//! * Storing service/handler configurations
//!
//! Check [`registry::SchemaRegistry`] for the schema registry implementation, implementing both read and write operations.
//!
//! Check the submodules [`deployment`], [`invocation_target`], [`service`] and [`subscriptions`] for the various read APIs.
//!
//! The [`Schema`] data structure is a serializable representation of this schema registry.
