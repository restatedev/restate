/// A clone-on-write smart pointer with an optimized memory layout, based on `beef`.
///
/// # Strings, strings everywhere
///
/// In `metrics`, strings are arguably the most common data type used despite the fact that metrics
/// are measuring numerical values. Both the name of a metric, and its labels, are strings: emitting
/// a metric may involve one string, or 10 strings. Many of these strings tend to be used over and
/// over during the life of the process, as well.
///
/// In order to achieve and maintain a high level of performance, we use a "clone-on-write" smart
/// pointer to handle passing these strings around. Doing so allows us to potentially avoid having
/// to allocate entire copies of a string, instead using a lightweight smart pointer that can live
/// on the stack.
///
/// # Why not `std::borrow::Cow`?
///
/// The standard library already provides a clone-on-write smart pointer, `std::borrow::Cow`, which
/// works well in many cases. However, `metrics` strives to provide minimal overhead where possible,
/// and so `std::borrow::Cow` falls down in one particular way: it uses an enum representation which
/// consumes an additional word of storage.
///
/// As an example, let's look at strings. A string in `std::borrow::Cow` implies that `T` is `str`,
/// and the owned version of `str` is simply `String`. Thus, for `std::borrow::Cow`, the in-memory
/// layout looks like this:
///
/// ```text
///                                                                       Padding

///                                                                          v

/// ```
///
/// As you can see, you pay a memory size penalty to be able to wrap an owned string. This
/// additional word adds minimal overhead, but we can easily avoid it with some clever logic around
/// the values of the length and capacity fields.
///
/// There is an existing crate that does just that: `beef`. Instead of using an enum, it is simply a
/// struct that encodes the discriminant values in the length and capacity fields directly. If we're
/// wrapping a borrowed value, we can infer that the "capacity" will always be zero, as we only need
/// to track the capacity when we're wrapping an owned value, in order to be able to recreate the
/// underlying storage when consuming the smart pointer, or dropping it. Instead of the above
/// layout, `beef` looks like this:
///
/// ```text
///                        +-------------+--------------+----------------+
/// `beef` Cow (borrowed): |   Pointer   |  Length (N)  |  Capacity (0)  |
///                        +-------------+--------------+----------------+
///                        +-------------+--------------+----------------+
/// `beef` Cow (owned):    |   Pointer   |  Length (N)  |  Capacity (M)  |
///                        +-------------+--------------+----------------+
/// ```
///
/// # Why not `beef`?
///
/// Up until this point, it might not be clear why we didn't just use `beef`. In truth, our design
/// is fundamentally based on `beef`. Crucially, however, `beef` did not/still does not support
/// `const` construction for generic slices.  Remember how we mentioned labels? The labels of a
/// metric `are `[Label]` under-the-hood, and so without a way to construct them in a `const`
/// fashion, our previous work to allow entirely static keys would not be possible.
///
/// Thus, we forked `beef` and copied into directly into `metrics` so that we could write a
/// specialized `const` constructor for `[Label]`.
///
/// This is why we have our own `Cow` bundled into `metrics` directly, which is based on `beef`. In
/// doing so, we can experiment with more interesting optimizations, and, as mentioned above, we can
/// add const methods to support all of the types involved in statically building metrics keys.
///
/// # What we do that `beef` doesn't do
///
/// It was already enough to use our own implementation for the specialized `const` capabilities,
/// but we've taken things even further in a key way: support for `Arc`-wrapped values.
///
/// ## `Arc`-wrapped values
///
/// For many strings, there is still a desire to share them cheaply even when they are constructed
/// at run-time.  Remember, cloning a `Cow` of an owned value means cloning the value itself, so we
/// need another level of indirection to allow the cheap sharing, which is where `Arc<T>` can
/// provide value.
///
/// Users can construct a `Arc<T>`, where `T` is lined up with the `T` of `metrics::Cow`, and use
/// that as the initial value instead. When `Cow` is cloned, we end up cloning the underlying
/// `Arc<T>` instead, avoiding a new allocation.  `Arc<T>` still handles all of the normal logic
/// necessary to know when the wrapped value must be dropped, and how many live references to the
/// value that there are, and so on.
///
/// We handle this by relying on an invariant of `Vec<T>`: it never allocates more than `isize::MAX`
/// [1]. This lets us derive the following truth table of the valid combinations of length/capacity:
///
/// ```text
///                         Length (N)     Capacity (M)
///                     +---------------+----------------+
/// Borrowed (&T):      |       N       |        0       |
///                     +---------------+----------------+
/// Owned (T::ToOwned): |       N       | M < usize::MAX |
///                     +---------------+----------------+
/// Shared (Arc<T>):    |       N       |   usize::MAX   |
///                     +---------------+----------------+
/// ```
///
/// As we only implement `Cow` for types where their owned variants are either explicitly or
/// implicitly backed by `Vec<_>`, we know that our capacity will never be `usize::MAX`, as it is
/// limited to `isize::MAX`, and thus we can safely encode our "shared" state within the capacity
/// field.
///
/// # Notes
///
/// [1] - technically, `Vec<T>` can have a capacity greater than `isize::MAX` when storing
/// zero-sized types, but we don't do that here, so we always enforce that an owned version's
/// capacity cannot be `usize::MAX` when constructing `Cow`.
