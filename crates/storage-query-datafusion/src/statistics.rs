/// The propagation of table size information *through* joins is important when there are multiple
/// joins in a query.
///
/// You might choose to set statistics on your table if:
/// a) You want to join it with some much smaller table (eg, sys_journal and sys_service)
/// b) You want to join it with a table of potentially similar size, but that result needs to be joined
///    with a much smaller table (eg, sys_invocation itself is a join, with its results being used in other joins).
///
/// The statistics needed are:
/// - The estimated row count (we use buckets that span several orders of magnitude)
/// - The estimated distinct count for every field being joined on. This is likely either the row count of
///   the current table (primary key), or of the table you're joining into (foreign key).
/// - The max and min value must be *set* but can be set as unbounded.
