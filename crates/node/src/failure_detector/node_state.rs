/// Node state transitions
///
/// We start by assuming that all nodes are [`NodeState::Dead`]. As we receive gossip messages, we start to
/// realise which nodes are alive and which are not. We have the option to speed up the initial
/// state view by fetching a full ClusterState from a random peer.
///
/// We don't run failure detection until we consider ourselves to be stable. Our view is considered
/// stable after we receive N number of gossip messages.
/// Possible states each node can be in. All nodes initially start as `Dead`, and
/// are moved into `Alive` as long as they have been [`NodeState::Suspect`] for `gossip_suspect_interval'
/// duration.
///
/// State transitions are as follows:
/// - `Dead` -> `Suspect`     When we observe that a dead node is potentially alive
/// - `Suspect` -> `Alive`    If it didn't fall back down to Dead in the last `gossip_suspect_interval` duration
/// - `Suspect -> `Dead`      If the node's gossip age grew above the failure threshold again
/// - `Alive -> `Dead`        If the `Alive` node's gossip age grew above the failure threshold
/// - `Alive -> `FailingOver` Node is performing a graceful shutdown, it's alive during shutdown.
///
/// The same transitions apply to our own node. We start dead and transition through `Suspect`
/// all the way to `Alive`.
