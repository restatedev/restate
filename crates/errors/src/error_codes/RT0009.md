## RT0009

Trying to open worker storage directory, configured via `worker.storage_rocksdb.path`, which contains no storage format version information. This indicates data corruption or that the data has been written with an incompatible Restate version < 0.8.

Suggestions:

* Wipe your meta storage directory to start afresh via `rm -rf <BASE_DIR>/${HOST}/db`.
* Configure a different worker storage directory via `worker.storage_rocksdb.path`.
* Downgrade your Restate server to < 0.8.
