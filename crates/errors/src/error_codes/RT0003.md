## RT0003

The invocation failed because the invoker received a message from a service larger than the `worker.invoker.message_size_limit`.

Suggestions:

* Check in your code whether there is a case where a very large message can be generated, such as a state entry being too large, a request payload being too large, etc.
* Increase the limit by tuning the `worker.invoker.message_size_limit` config entry, eventually tuning the memory of your operating system/machine where Restate is running.
