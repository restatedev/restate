## RT0016

Journal mismatch detected when replaying the invocation: the handler generated a sequence of journal entries (thus context operations) that doesn't exactly match the recorded journal.
This indicates that either the service code was changed (e.g. the service container image updated) without registering a new version of the service deployment, or some code within the handler is non-deterministic.
Some common mistakes that lead to non-deterministic errors are:

* Branch the execution flow based on some non-deterministic information, such as the elapsed time between now and another timestamp, or the result of an HTTP request that was not recorded using the `ctx.run` feature.
* A parameter passed to a `Context` operation is non-deterministic, for example setting a state key using a random value or the current date-time.
* Execute a sequence of `Context` operations, such as calling other services, while iterating over a data structure with non-deterministic iteration order (such as sets/maps/dictionaries).
