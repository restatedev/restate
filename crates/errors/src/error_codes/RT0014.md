## RT0014

The server cannot resume an in-flight invocation which has been started with a now incompatible service protocol version. Restate does not support upgrading service protocols yet.

Suggestions:

* Downgrade the server to a version which is compatible with the used service protocol version
* Kill the affected invocation via the CLI.
