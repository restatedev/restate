## RT0018

The request submitted through the `Context` API to the given service handler cannot be processed, because the service handler doesn't exist.

Make sure the service/handler is registered, by using `restate svc ls` or through the UI:

* If the service/handler is correctly registered, you can ignore this error as it's a transient error, due to internal propagation of the cluster metadata.
* If the service/handler is not registered, you must register it in order for this invocation to progress.
