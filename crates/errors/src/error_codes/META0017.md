## META0017

Cannot force-add the provided URI/ARN as a new deployment, because two or more existing deployments use this URI.

Generally Restate enforces that there is only one deployment for a given destination (a HTTP URI or Lambda ARN). This means
that redicovering the same destination requires a `force` flag. Adding a deployment in force mode instructs Restate to replace the existing deployment
with that destination, with the discovered metadata. This relies on there being an unambigious deployment to replace.

When using the `PUT /deployments/{deployment_id}` API to update a deployment in place, it is possible to create two deployments that have the same destination.
This is intended to be a temporary measure to fix failing invocations on a draining deployment. While in this state, it is not possible to force deploy that same destination.
Instead, one of the two deployments must be deleted (`DELETE /deployments/{deployment_id}`) so that there is an unambiguous deployment to replace.

See the [versioning documentation](https://docs.restate.dev/operate/versioning) for more information.
