## META0011

Non-empty meta storage directory, configured via `meta.storage_path`, is missing the version file. This indicates data corruption or that the data has been written with an incompatible Restate version < 0.8.

Suggestions:

* Wipe your meta storage directory to start afresh via `rm -rf <BASE_DIR>/<NODE_NAME>/local-metadata-store`.
* Configure a different meta storage directory via `meta.storage_path`.
* Downgrade your Restate server to {'<='} 0.7.
