## META0015

The service discovery response suggested that the SDK is serving in
bidirectional protocol mode, but discovery did not go over HTTP2.

Lambda endpoints and endpoints discovered with `--use-http1.1` do not support
the bidirectional protocol mode. If your SDK cannot serve over HTTP2 prior
knowledge then it should be configured to operate in the request-response
protocol mode.
