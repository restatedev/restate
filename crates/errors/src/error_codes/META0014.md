## META0014

Service discovery response failed, and the server may have responded in HTTP1.1.
This can happen when discovering locally running dev servers from Faas platforms
eg `wrangler dev` or `cargo lambda watch`. FaaS platforms in production
generally will support HTTP2, however, so this is generally only a local
development concern.

You can try to discover the endpoint with `use_http_11` set to true when working
with these dev servers. This should not be needed in production and is not
recommended.
