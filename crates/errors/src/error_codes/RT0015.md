## RT0015

The server can't establish an invocation stream because the SDK does not support the service protocol version negotiated during discovery.

This indicates that the SDK was updated to a new version that dropped support for old service protocol versions, but no re-registration was performed.  

Suggestions:

* For in-flight invocations, downgrade the SDK version back to the previous version.
* For new invocations, register a new deployment with a new endpoint as described in the [versioning documentation](https://docs.restate.dev/operate/versioning#deploying-new-service-versions).  
* Make sure the new SDK is compatible with this runtime version, for more info check out [Service compatibility](https://docs.restate.dev/operate/upgrading#service-compatibility).
