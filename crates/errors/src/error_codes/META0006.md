## META0006

Cannot register the newly discovered service revision in the provided deployment, because it conflicts with an already existing service revision.

When implementing a new service revision, make sure that:

* The service instance type and the key definition, if any, are exactly the same as of the previous revisions.
* The Protobuf contract and message definitions are backward compatible.
  * The new revision must implement all the methods of the previous revisions.

See the [versioning documentation](https://docs.restate.dev/services/upgrades-removal) for more information.
