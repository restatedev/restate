## META0006

Cannot register the newly discovered service revision in the provided deployment, because it conflicts with an already existing service revision.

When implementing a new service revision, make sure that:

* The service type is the same as the previous revision.
* The new revision contains at least all the handlers of the previous revision.

See the [versioning documentation](https://docs.restate.dev/operate/versioning) for more information.
