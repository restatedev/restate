## META0006

Cannot register the newly discovered component revision in the provided deployment, because it conflicts with an already existing component revision.

When implementing a new component revision, make sure that:

* The component type is the same as the previous revision.
* The new revision contains at least all the handlers of the previous revision.

See the [versioning documentation](https://docs.restate.dev/operate/versioning) for more information.
