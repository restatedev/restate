## META0009

The provided subscription is invalid. Subscriptions should have:

* A `source` field in the format of `kafka://<CLUSTER_NAME>/<TOPIC_NAME>`. When registering, the Kafka cluster should be configured in the Restate configuration.
* A `sink` field in the format of `service://<service_NAME>/<HANDLER_NAME>`. When registering, service and handler should be available already in the registry, meaning they have been previously registered.
* Additional constraints may apply depending on the sink service type.

Please look at the [Kafka documentation page](https://docs.restate.dev/develop/sdk/kafka) for more details on subscriptions and event handlers.
