## META0009

The provided subscription is invalid. Subscriptions should have:

* A `source` field in the format of `kafka://<CLUSTER_NAME>/<TOPIC_NAME>`. When registering, the Kafka cluster should be configured in the Restate configuration.
* A `sink` field in the format of `component://<COMPONENT_NAME>/<HANDLER_NAME>`. When registering, component and handler should be available already in the registry, meaning they have been previously registered.
* Additional constraints may apply depending on the sink component type.

Please look at the Kafka documentation (for [TypeScript](https://docs.restate.dev/develop/ts/kafka) and [Java](https://docs.restate.dev/develop/java/kafka)) for more details on subscriptions and event handlers.
