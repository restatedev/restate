## META0016

Cannot update the provided deployment with the discovered metadata, because the new metadata is insufficiently similar to the old.

When updating a deployment, make sure that:

* All services have the same type as they did in the previous deployment.
* All services contain at least all the handlers that they did in the previous deployment.
* The updated deployment contains at least all the services that it previously did.
* The updated deployment has exactly the same supported protocol versions, which generally means you want to use the same SDK minor version.

See the [versioning documentation](https://docs.restate.dev/operate/versioning) for more information.
