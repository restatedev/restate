## RT0013

The service endpoint does not support any of the supported service protocol versions of the server. 
Please make sure that the service endpoint's SDK and the Restate server are compatible.

Suggestions:

* Register a service endpoint which uses an SDK which is compatible with the used server
* Upgrade the server to a version which is compatible with the used SDK
