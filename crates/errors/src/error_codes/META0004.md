## META0004

Cannot register the provided deployment, because it conflicts with the uri of an already registered deployment.

In Restate deployments have a unique uri/arn and are immutable, thus it's not possible to discover the same deployment twice. 
Make sure, when updating a deployment, to assign it a new uri/arn. 

You can force the override using the `"force": true` field in the discover request, but beware that this can lead in-flight invocations to an unrecoverable error state.  

See the [versioning documentation](https://docs.restate.dev/operate/versioning) for more information.
