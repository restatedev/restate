## META0014

Service discovery response failed, and the server may have responded in HTTP1.1.
This can happen when discovering locally running dev servers from Faas platforms
eg `wrangler dev`. FaaS platforms in generally will support HTTP2, however, so
this is only a local development concern.

You can try to discover the endpoint with `--use-http1.1` when working
with these local dev servers. This should not be needed in production.
