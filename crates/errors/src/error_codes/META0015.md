## META0015

The service discovery response suggested that the SDK is serving in
bidirectional protocol mode, but discovery is going over a protocol that does
not support it (currently only Lambda).

Lambda endpoints do not support the bidirectional protocol mode and should be
configured to announce themselves as being in request-response mode upon
discovery.
