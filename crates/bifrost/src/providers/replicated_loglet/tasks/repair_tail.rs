/// # Overview
///
/// The primary reason for why we need such a procedure is because the sequencer node marks the record as
/// released _before_ it sends out a Release message to log-servers. In other words, we don't require a
/// quorum of nodes to acknowledge the `Release` message to consider a record committed. This is an important
/// design optimization to reduce latency of the write path. The sequencer needs 1-RTT (store wave) to commit
/// a record rather than 2-RTT (store+release).
///
/// The tradeoff is the speed at which we can determine the last global committed tail if the sequencer is not
/// available. There is a number of optimizations that can be added to improve the efficiency of this operation,
/// those include but are not limited to:
/// 1. Log-servers persisting the last known_global_tail periodically/async and using this value as known_global_tail on startup.
/// 2. Sequencer-driven seal. If the sequencer is alive, it can send a special value with the seal message to
///    indicate what is the ultimate known-global-tail that nodes should repair to instead of relying on the observed max-tail.
/// 3. Limit `from_offset` to repair from to max(min(local_tails), max(known_global_tails), known_archived, trim_point)
/// 4. Archiving records to the external object-store instead of re-replication, although, this
///    doesn't improve the efficiency of the repair operation itself.
///
/// The repair process must be reentrant, fault-tolerant, and yields correct immutable state of the
/// tail even with concurrent runs.
///
/// # Details
///
/// ## Digest Phase (where are my records?)
/// Given the input range [max(known_global_tails)..max-local-tail], determine the biggest offset at which we can
/// find evidence of a write-quorum of a record, including unauthoritative nodes (`StorageState::DataLoss`).
/// Let's call this `max_known_durable_offset`. We narrow down the repair range to [max_known_durable_offset+1..max-local-tail).
/// If len()=0, we have no work to do. max-local-tail is fully replicated.
///
/// Ask nodes to send a digest first before reading the records? Who has what.
/// - For a digest request [start_offset, max-tail-requested]
/// - Node sends a list that looks like this:
///   FROM           TO  -> STATUS
///   [start_offset..t1] -> A (Archived)                      Good to know. (A = Archived)
///   [t2..t10]          -> X (Exists)                        len = t10-t1 = 9 records exists on this node
///   [t11..t11]         -> X
///   this implies [t12..max-tail-requested-1) has no records.
///
/// ## Replication Phase (restore replication)
///
/// Starting from the beginning of the range, we create a special read-stream to read records up to
/// the target tail.
/// Then we send a store wave to fixup the replication of this record while ignoring the seal flag to achieve write-quorum.
/// We use knowledge obtained from digests to decide which nodes to replicate to, if insufficient nodes are writeable.
/// [Future] Batch the set of records and upload to object-store. Update the archived pointer a write-quorum of nodes after upload.
/// The write-quorum is not strictly required in the case where the object-store allows a cheap query to ask if an offset is archived or not.
///
/// Update the known_global_tail to allow nodes to move their local-tail during repair. This also allows them to persist this value.
///
/// ## todo: Completion Phase (try to avoid same-range repair in future runs)
/// Once max-tail is reached. Send a Release message with special flag (repair) to update log-servers with the newly agreed-upon
/// known_global_tail. This is a best-effort phase and it should not block the completion of the repair task.
